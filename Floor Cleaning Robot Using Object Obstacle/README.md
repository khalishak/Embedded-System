# Floor Cleaning Robot Using Object Obstacle

This project involves creating an autonomous floor cleaning robot that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles in its path. The robot is designed to autonomously navigate through a room and clean the floor while avoiding obstacles such as walls and furniture. The system uses Arduino-based controllers for managing the sensors and motors.

## Features:
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: The robot detects obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and adjusts its path accordingly.
- **Movement Control**: The robot moves forward, backward, and turns left or right based on sensor readings.
- **Autonomous Operation**: The robot runs autonomously without requiring manual control and can avoid obstacles while cleaning.
