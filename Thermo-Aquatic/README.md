# Thermo Aquatic

## Project Overview

The **Thermo Aquatic** project is an automated system designed to monitor and regulate the temperature in **tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)** fish farming ponds. This system ensures optimal temperature conditions for fish health and growth. Using an **Arduino Uno R3** microcontroller, the project reads data from a **DS18B20 temperature sensor** and displays it on an **LCD I2C screen**. The system automatically controls a **heater** via a **relay module** to maintain the desired water temperature in the pond.

## Features
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Continuously measures water temperature using a DS18B20 sensor.
- **Real-time Display**: Displays the water temperature on an LCD screen.
- **Automated Heater Control**: Turns a heating device on or off based on the water temperature to maintain the optimal temperature range for tilapia.
- **Easy Integration**: The system can be adapted for other types of aquatic environments by adjusting temperature thresholds or components.
